After that, install all the dependencies of the project with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gem install bundle
  rbenv rehash
  bundle install
#+END_SRC

*** Create the database
Execute the following to create the database and generate the required tables
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  bin/rake db:create
  bin/rake db:migrate
#+END_SRC

*** Run the server
Finally, run the server with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  bin/rails server
